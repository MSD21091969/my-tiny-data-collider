# AI Autonomous Execution Test

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Purpose:** Verify AI can execute autonomously with proper context

---

## ðŸ§ª Quick Test Task

**Task:** Create a simple test file to verify autonomous execution works.

### Instructions for AI Assistant:

1. **Read context files:**
   - `.github/AI-AGENT-CONFIG.md`
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - `AI/recommendations/FASTAPI-REFACTORING-PLAN.md`

2. **Create a test file:**
   - File: `src/coreservice/test_autonomous.py`
   - Content: Simple function that demonstrates understanding of R-A-R pattern
   - Include: Type hints, docstring, proper imports

3. **Write a test:**
   - File: `tests/coreservice/test_autonomous.py`
   - Test the function you created
   - Follow pytest conventions

4. **Validate:**
   - Run: `pytest tests/coreservice/test_autonomous.py -v`
   - Should pass

5. **Report:**
   - Tell me what you did
   - Show test results
