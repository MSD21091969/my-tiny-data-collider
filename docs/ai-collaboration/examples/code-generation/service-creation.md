# Service Creation Example

*Last updated: October 7, 2025*

Complete example of AI-assisted service creation for the my-tiny-data-collider repository.

## ðŸŽ¯ Context

**Task**: Create a new casefile search service that allows filtering casefiles by multiple criteria.

**Codebase State**:
- Existing CasefileService with basic CRUD operations
- Pydantic models for Casefile data structures
- Repository pattern with Firestore integration
- Tool decorator pattern for AI integration

**Requirements**:
- Support multiple filter criteria (status, tags, date ranges, assignee)
- Return paginated results with metadata
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Follow existing service patterns and architecture

## ðŸ’¬ Initial Prompt

```
Create a new casefile search service for the my-tiny-data-collider repository.

Context:
- This is a Python FastAPI application using Pydantic models
- Services follow the Service-Repository pattern
- Casefile data is stored in Firestore
- Existing CasefileService provides basic CRUD operations
- Tool decorators are used for AI integration

Requirements:
1. Create CasefileSearchService class in src/casefileservice/
2. Implement search_casefiles method with filtering capabilities
3. Support filters: status, tags, created_date range, updated_date range, assignee
4. Return paginated results with total count
5. Include proper error handling and input validation
6. Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
7. Add comprehensive docstrings

Existing patterns to follow:
- Look at CasefileService for service structure
- Use Pydantic models from pydantic_models/
- Follow async/await patterns
- Include proper exception handling
```

## ðŸ¤– AI Initial Response

The AI generated a complete service implementation:

```python
# src/casefileservice/search_service.py
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any
from datetime import datetime
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from ..pydantic_models.casefile import Casefile
from ..core.id_service import IdService
from ..persistence.firestore.repository import FirestoreRepository

class CasefileSearchFilters(BaseModel):
    """Search filters for casefile queries."""
    status: Optional[str] = None
    tags: Optional[List[str]] = None
    created_after: Optional[datetime] = None
    created_before: Optional[datetime] = None
    updated_after: Optional[datetime] = None
    updated_before: Optional[datetime] = None
    assignee: Optional[str] = None

class CasefileSearchResult(BaseModel):
    """Paginated search result."""
    casefiles: List[Casefile] = Field(default_factory=list)
    total_count: int = 0
    page: int = 1
    page_size: int = 20
    has_next: bool = False
    has_previous: bool = False

class CasefileSearchService:
    """Service for advanced casefile search operations."""

    def __init__(self, repository: FirestoreRepository, id_service: IdService):
        self.repository = repository
        self.id_service = id_service

    async def search_casefiles(
        self,
        filters: CasefileSearchFilters,
        page: int = 1,
        page_size: int = 20
    ) -> CasefileSearchResult:
        """
        Search casefiles with advanced filtering and pagination.

        Args:
            filters: Search criteria to apply
            page: Page number (1-based)
            page_size: Number of results per page

        Returns:
            Paginated search results

        Raises:
            ValueError: If pagination parameters are invalid
        """
        if page < 1:
            raise ValueError("Page must be >= 1")
        if page_size < 1 or page_size > 100:
            raise ValueError("Page size must be between 1 and 100")

        # Build Firestore query
        query = self.repository.collection("casefiles")

        # Apply filters
        if filters.status:
            query = query.where("status", "==", filters.status)
        if filters.assignee:
            query = query.where("assignee", "==", filters.assignee)
        if filters.tags:
            # Firestore array-contains-any for tag filtering
            query = query.where("tags", "array-contains-any", filters.tags)

        # Date range filters (requires composite queries or client-side filtering)
        # Note: Firestore has limitations on multiple inequality filters

        # Execute query with pagination
        offset = (page - 1) * page_size
        docs = query.offset(offset).limit(page_size).stream()

        casefiles = []
        for doc in docs:
            data = doc.to_dict()
            data['id'] = doc.id
            casefiles.append(Casefile(**data))

        # Get total count (this is approximate due to Firestore limitations)
        total_count = len(casefiles)  # Simplified for this example

        # Calculate pagination metadata
        has_next = len(casefiles) == page_size
        has_previous = page > 1

        return CasefileSearchResult(
            casefiles=casefiles,
            total_count=total_count,
            page=page,
            page_size=page_size,
            has_next=has_next,
            has_previous=has_previous
        )
```

## ðŸ”„ Feedback & Iteration

**Human Feedback**:
```
The implementation looks good but has some issues:

1. Firestore doesn't support multiple inequality filters well - the date range filtering won't work as implemented
2. Total count calculation is incorrect - it only counts the current page
3. Missing proper error handling for Firestore exceptions
4. Need to handle the date filtering on the client side or restructure the query
5. Should include the existing casefile validation patterns

Please revise with these improvements.
```

**AI Revised Response**:
The AI updated the implementation with proper Firestore query handling, client-side filtering for complex queries, accurate counting, and better error handling.

## âœ… Final Result

The final implementation included:
- Proper Firestore query construction with client-side filtering for complex criteria
- Accurate pagination with total count estimation
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
- Full Pydantic model validation
- Integration with existing service patterns
- Comprehensive docstrings and type hints

## ðŸ§ª Quality Validation

**Testing Performed**:
- Unit tests for all filter combinations
- Integration tests with actual Firestore data
