# AI Conversation Practices

*Last updated: October 7, 2025*

Guidelines for effective communication and collaboration with AI assistants in software development.

## üéØ Core Principles

### Communication Standards
- **Clarity**: Use precise, unambiguous language
- **Context**: Provide sufficient background and constraints
- **Specificity**: Define exact requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Structure**: Organize requests in logical, scannable formats

### Collaboration Mindset
- **Partnership**: Treat AI as a collaborative tool, not replacement
- **Iteration**: Expect and plan for multiple refinement cycles
- **Validation**: Always verify and test AI-generated outputs
- **Learning**: Document patterns and improve practices over time

## üìã Conversation Framework

### 1. Context Establishment
**Before making requests, provide:**
- Project overview and current state
- Technology stack and architecture
- Existing patterns and conventions
- Specific constraints and requirements
- Success criteria and quality standards

### 2. Task Definition
**For each request, clearly specify:**
- **What**: Exact deliverables and outcomes
- **Why**: Business or technical rationale
- **How**: Preferred approaches or patterns
- **When**: Timeline and priority considerations
- **Who**: Target audience or system users

### 3. Quality Assurance
**Define validation criteria:**
- Functional requirements and edge cases
- Performance and scalability needs
- Security and compliance standards
- Testing and documentation requirements
- Code review and integration standards

### 4. Iterative Refinement
**Plan for multiple cycles:**
- Initial implementation request
- Feedback and clarification rounds
- Incremental improvements
- Final validation and acceptance

## üí¨ Communication Patterns

### Effective Request Structure
```
Context: [Project background, current state, constraints]
Task: [Specific deliverable and requirements]
Approach: [Preferred methods, patterns, or technologies]
Validation: [How to verify correctness and quality]
Examples: [Reference implementations or similar patterns]
```

### Question Types
- **Closed-ended**: For specific, verifiable answers
- **Open-ended**: For exploration and brainstorming
- **Comparative**: For evaluating options and trade-offs
- **Diagnostic**: For troubleshooting and problem analysis

### Feedback Techniques
- **Specific Praise**: Highlight exactly what works well
- **Constructive Criticism**: Explain issues with suggested fixes
- **Contextual Examples**: Show before/after comparisons
- **Priority Ranking**: Indicate which issues to address first

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflows

### Code Generation Workflow
1. **Planning**: Define requirements and constraints
2. **Scaffolding**: Request initial implementation
3. **Refinement**: Provide feedback and request improvements
4. **Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing codebase
5. **Testing**: Validate functionality and performance
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

### Debugging Workflow
1. **Problem Description**: Clearly state symptoms and impact
2. **Context Sharing**: Provide error messages, logs, and environment
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Work through potential causes systematically
4. **Solution Implementation**: Apply fixes incrementally
5. **Verification**: Confirm problem resolution and test edge cases

### Review and Refinement Workflow
1. **Initial Assessment**: Quick evaluation of overall approach
2. **Detailed Feedback**: Specific comments on code quality
3. **Prioritized Improvements**: Address critical issues first
4. **Pattern Alignment**: Ensure consistency with project standards
5. **Final Validation**: Confirm all requirements are met

## üìä Quality Standards

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Functionality**: Meets all specified requirements
- **Performance**: Acceptable response times and resource usage
- **Security**: No vulnerabilities or unsafe patterns
- **Maintainability**: Readable, well-documented, and extensible
- **Testability**: Includes appropriate test coverage

### Documentation Standards
- **Completeness**: Covers all public interfaces and usage patterns
- **Accuracy**: Correctly describes functionality and behavior
- **Clarity**: Accessible to target audience skill levels
- **Consistency**: Follows project documentation conventions
- **Maintenance**: Updated when code changes

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Cover individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Validate component interactions
- **Edge Cases**: Handle error conditions and boundary values
- **Performance Tests**: Verify scalability and efficiency
- **Regression Tests**: Prevent reintroduction of known issues

## üö´ Common Pitfalls

### Communication Issues
- **Vague Requirements**: Unclear or ambiguous specifications
- **Missing Context**: Insufficient background information
- **Over-specification**: Micromanaging implementation details
- **Single-shot Requests**: Expecting perfect solutions on first attempt

### Quality Problems
- **Untested Code**: Missing validation and error handling
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Not following project conventions
- **Security Oversights**: Ignoring authentication and authorization
- **Performance Issues**: Not considering scalability requirements

### Process Problems
- **No Iteration**: Accepting first response without review
- **Poor Feedback**: Vague or unhelpful criticism
- **Context Switching**: Not maintaining conversation continuity
- **Documentation Gaps**: Not recording successful patterns

## üéØ Best Practices

### Preparation
- **Research First**: Understand problem domain before asking
- **Gather Context**: Collect relevant code, docs, and examples
- **Define Scope**: Know what you're asking for and why
- **Set Boundaries**: Specify what's in/out of scope

### During Collaboration
- **Stay Focused**: Keep conversations on-topic and goal-oriented
- **Provide Feedback**: Give specific, actionable input
- **Ask Questions**: Seek clarification when needed
- **Document Decisions**: Record important choices and rationale

### Follow-up
- **Validate Results**: Test and review all outputs thoroughly
- **Share Learnings**: Document successful patterns for future use
- **Update Templates**: Refine prompts based on experiences
- **Provide Feedback**: Help improve AI assistance capabilities

## üìà Continuous Improvement

### Learning from Experience
- **Success Analysis**: Study what works well and why
- **Failure Review**: Understand mistakes and prevention strategies
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring successful approaches
- **Template Evolution**: Update prompts based on outcomes

### Team Collaboration
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share effective techniques with team members
- **Standard Development**: Create team-specific guidelines and templates
- **Feedback Loops**: Regular reviews of AI collaboration effectiveness
- **Tool Assessment**: Evaluate and recommend AI assistance tools
