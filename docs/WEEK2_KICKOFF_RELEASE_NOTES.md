# Week 2 Kickoff Release Notes

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Version:** Tool Factory MVP → Week 2 Parallelization

---

## Summary
- Completed Week 1 deliverable: YAML-driven tool factory producing the `echo_tool` with 9/9 unit tests passing.
- Published architectural documentation covering layered flow, policy enforcement, and YAML-driven modeling.
- Cleaned repository structure, consolidated generated artefacts, and refreshed onboarding docs (`README.md`, `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`).
- Established branching strategy and created integration branch `develop` plus six Week 2 feature branches for parallel execution.

## Branching Changes
| Branch | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feature/tool-factory-week1` | Holds the Tool Factory MVP work product and serves as the baseline for Week 2. | ✅ Completed, pushed |
| `develop` | Integration branch for all Week 2 features before merging to `main`. | ✅ Created, tracking `origin/develop` |
| `feature/integration-test-templates` | Service-layer integration test generation. | ✅ Created |
| `feature/api-test-templates` | HTTP/API test generation. | ✅ Created |
| `feature/google-workspace-gmail` | Gmail toolset implementation. | ✅ Created |
| `feature/google-workspace-drive` | Drive toolset implementation. | ✅ Created |
| `feature/google-workspace-sheets` | Sheets toolset implementation. | ✅ Created |
| `feature/tool-composition` | Tool chaining/composition engine. | ✅ Created |

## Testing
- `python -m pytest tests/generated/test_echo_tool.py -v` → **PASS (9/9)**
- No new automated tests introduced in this release; coverage remains focused on the Tool Factory MVP.

## Documentation Updates
- Added policy, architecture, and YAML modeling guides under `docs/`.
- Authored Week 2 branch strategy reference (`docs/FEATURE_BRANCH_STRATEGY.md`).
- Delivered cleanup reports summarizing removed artefacts and repository hygiene.

## Known Issues & Risks
- Integration and API test templates still pending implementation (tracked on respective feature branches).
- Google Workspace toolsets require OAuth2 plumbing and quota management—owners should budget time for credential setup.
- Tool composition design needs agreement on execution semantics before heavy implementation begins.

## Next Steps
1. Assign developers to the newly created feature branches.
2. Kick off development per `docs/FEATURE_BRANCH_STRATEGY.md` timeline.
3. Maintain regular merges into `develop` and keep documentation in sync.
4. Plan Week 2 endgame: regression testing on `develop` followed by merge to `main`.
