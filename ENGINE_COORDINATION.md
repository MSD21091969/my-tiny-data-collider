# Coordination: feature/tool-execution-engine Update

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Source:** feature/tool-execution-engine progress update  
**Branch:** feature/src-services-integration

## Engine Branch Status

**Current Work:**
- ChainExecutor tests and execution setup
- Method wrapper execution configuration for chain steps
- Service and tool model definitions
- Execution engine wiring with ChainExecutor
- Test implementation for successful execution and error handling
- Service initialization management
- Consistent error type reporting

**Next:** Implementing changes starting with chain_executor.py

## Impact on feature/src-services-integration

### 1. ChainExecutor Coordination

**We Have (src/pydantic_ai_integration/execution/chain_executor.py):**
- Basic chain execution framework
- Sequential tool execution
- Conditional branching (on_success, on_failure)
- State passing between steps
- Error recovery strategies
- 312 lines implemented

**Engine Branch Adding:**
- Method wrapper execution in chain steps
- Service initialization in chains
- Enhanced error handling
- Tests for chain execution

**Action Required:** Review chain_executor.py changes from engine branch to avoid conflicts with our implementation.

### 2. Service Initialization

**Conflict Point:** Both branches handle service instantiation
- **Our approach:** _instantiate_service with hardcoded map (tool_decorator.py:809)
- **Engine approach:** Service initialization for chain execution

**Resolution Strategy:**
When engine merges, we'll need to:
1. Check if engine implements ServiceContainer/registry
2. If yes: adopt their pattern
3. If no: proceed with our DI implementation plan
4. Ensure chain_executor uses same service instantiation as tools

### 3. Error Type Consistency

**Our Error Types (tool_decorator.py):**
- ServiceInstantiationError
- RequestDTOBuildError
- TimeoutError
- MethodNotFoundError
- ToolExecutionError

**Action:** Verify engine branch uses compatible error types for chain execution. Update SYSTEM_ASSESSMENT.md if needed.

### 4. Method Wrapper in Chains

**Current:** Tools use method_wrapper execution type
**Engine Adding:** Method wrapper support in chain steps

**Integration Point:**
Chain steps should call tools which already have method wrapper support:
```python
# Chain step configuration
{
    "tool": "create_casefile_tool",  # Tool has method_wrapper
    "inputs": {...},
    "on_success": {...}
}
```

**Verification Needed:** Does engine's method wrapper in chains call existing tools or implement parallel logic?

## Coordination Actions

### Immediate
1. **Monitor:** Watch for engine branch completion
2. **Review:** Check chain_executor.py changes when pushed
3. **Document:** Note any service initialization patterns they introduce

### Before Merge
4. **Compare:** Diff engine's chain_executor.py vs ours (312 lines)
5. **Identify:** Find duplicate service instantiation logic
6. **Plan:** Determine if DI container should come from engine or us

### After Merge
7. **Integrate:** Unify service instantiation across tools and chains
8. **Test:** Run both tool tests and chain tests
9. **Consolidate:** Single error type enum for all execution

## Notes for Implementation

**If engine implements service registry:**
- Adopt their pattern immediately
- Update tool_decorator.py to use their registry
- Document migration from hardcoded map

**If engine still has hardcoded services:**
- Proceed with our DI container implementation
- Offer to refactor their chain service init to use container
- Provide migration guide for both tools and chains

**Error handling alignment:**
- Create shared error types module
- Both tool execution and chain execution use same types
- Consistent error structure across all execution modes

## Test Coverage Strategy

**Our Tests:** 541 lines for tool execution (direct, DTO, mock, dry_run, verify, error, performance)

**Engine Tests:** Chain execution tests incoming

**Combined Coverage Should Include:**
- Tool execution (standalone)
- Chain execution (sequential tools)
- Tool execution within chains
- Service initialization in both contexts
- Error propagation tool → chain
- Dry run for both tools and chains

## Status Summary

- ✓ Our chain_executor.py exists (312 lines)
- ⚠ Engine adding tests and method wrapper support
- ⚠ Service initialization needs coordination
- ⚠ Error types need alignment
- ⏳ Waiting for engine branch completion

**Next:** Continue monitoring engine progress, be ready to review chain_executor.py changes.
