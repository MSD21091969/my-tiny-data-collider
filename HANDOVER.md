# Dev Branch Handover

## Snapshot
- Branch: `develop`
- Date: 5 Oct 2025
- Scope: Strip legacy/tool-generated artefacts, stabilise async testing, document regeneration workflow.

## What was delivered
1. **ToolFactory ready for production**
   - `scripts/generate_tools.py` now resolves the project root deterministically.
   - Generator templates emit canonical import paths (`src.pydantic_ai_integration.integrations.google_workspace`, `src.pydantic_models.operations.*`).
   - Tool metadata gained `yaml_relative_path`/`generated_module_import`, enabling consistent tests and documentation strings.

2. **Generated artefacts cleared for regeneration**
   - Deleted `src/pydantic_ai_integration/tools/generated/**` and matching `tests/unit|integration|api/**` trees so future regeneration starts from a clean slate.
   - Replaced usage of legacy example tools in `tests/integration/test_tool_response_wrapping.py` with an inline stub registered via `@register_mds_tool`.
   - Conftest modules gracefully no-op when the generated directories are absent.

3. **Runtime + async testing stabilised**
   - Verified Firestore-backed repositories (`casefileservice`, `communicationservice`, `tool_sessionservice`, `persistence/firestore`) remain intact and continue to back the services.
   - Confirmed `execution/firebase_stub.py` is still required for composite tools/local Firestore emulation.
   - Re-enabled `pytest-asyncio`; async tests now run without configuration warnings (`pytest tests/integration/test_tool_response_wrapping.py -q`).

4. **Documentation refresh**
   - Updated sub-package README files to describe the new import surface and compatibility posture.
   - Root `README.md` trimmed to the essentials and points to deeper references.

## Validation
- `pytest tests/integration/test_tool_response_wrapping.py -q`
   - Result: **PASS** (async tests executed with `pytest-asyncio`).
- `generate-tools` (run locally) will recreate the previously deleted tool/test folders.

## Outstanding considerations
- Generated directories are intentionally empty; guard rails fail loudly if old imports persist.
- Firestore stub + repository layers still gate local development; swap for production services when ready.
- Agent runtime remains a stub (`tools/agents/base.py`) awaiting production integration.

## Next steps for maintainers
1. Keep the YAML schema authoritativeâ€”any new tool work should start there.
2. Regenerate (`python scripts/generate_tools.py`) after YAML or template changes; commit both YAML and regenerated outputs.
3. Keep handwritten regression tests (e.g., `tests/integration/test_tool_response_wrapping.py`) up to date with runtime adjustments.
4. Once regenerated, ensure async suites stay green by running `pytest` with the plugin-enabled environment.
