# Branching Strategy Discussion

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Project:** My Tiny Data Collider  
**Context:** About to implement Tool Factory (Week 1 from TOOLENGINEERING_FOUNDATION.md)

---

## 🎯 Current Situation

- ✅ Main branch: Stable, 24 tests passing
- ✅ Clean codebase, no errors
- ✅ Ready to implement Tool Factory
- ❓ Need branching strategy for development

---

## 🌿 Branching Strategy Options

### Option 1: Feature Branch (Recommended)

**Structure:**
```
main (stable)
  ↓
feature/tool-factory (development)
  ↓
  [Work happens here]
  ↓
PR → main (when complete)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Main stays stable
- ✅ Can test thoroughly before merge
- ✅ Easy to abandon if approach doesn't work
- ✅ Clear history of what changed

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Might get out of sync with main
- ⚠️ Need to merge eventually

**Best For:** This project - building major new feature (tool factory)

---

### Option 2: Topic Branches (Granular)

**Structure:**
```
main
  ↓
  ├── feature/tool-factory-yaml-schema
  ├── feature/tool-factory-generator
  ├── feature/tool-factory-templates
  └── feature/tool-factory-tests
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Very focused changes
- ✅ Easy to review
- ✅ Can merge incrementally

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More branches to manage
- ⚠️ Overhead for small team
- ⚠️ Dependencies between branches

**Best For:** Large teams, complex features

---

### Option 3: Trunk-Based (Direct to Main)

**Structure:**
```
main (all work here)
  ↓
  [Commit directly]
  ↓
  [Feature flags control visibility]
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple
- ✅ Always integrated
- ✅ No merge conflicts

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Main can become unstable
- ⚠️ Need feature flags
- ⚠️ Risk breaking tests

**Best For:** Solo developers with high confidence

---

### Option 4: GitFlow (Full Process)

**Structure:**
```
main (production)
  ↓
develop (integration)
  ↓
feature/tool-factory (development)
  ↓
release/v1.0 (staging)
  ↓
hotfix/bug-fix (emergency)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Very organized
- ✅ Clear release process
- ✅ Good for teams

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Overkill for solo/small team
- ⚠️ Complex to manage
- ⚠️ Slower development

**Best For:** Enterprise teams, multiple releases

---

## 💡 Recommendation for This Project

### **Use Feature Branch Strategy**

**Branch Name:** `feature/tool-factory-week1`

**Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from main
git checkout -b feature/tool-factory-week1

# 2. Work on tool factory (5-7 days)
#    - Create YAML schema
#    - Build generator script
#    - Create templates
#    - Generate first tool
#    - Test everything

# 3. Commit regularly with clear messages
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add YAML schema for tool definitions"
git commit -m "feat: create tool factory generator script"
git commit -m "feat: add Jinja2 templates for code generation"
git commit -m "test: generate echo_tool from YAML"

# 4. Keep tests passing at each commit
pytest

# 5. When complete, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/tool-factory-week1

# 6. Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/tool-factory-week1
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Main stays stable (24 tests passing)
- ✅ Experimental work isolated
- ✅ Can show progress in branch
- ✅ Easy to review before merge
- ✅ Simple for solo developer

## 📅 Week 1 Plan with Branching

### Day 1: Setup Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/tool-factory-week1
```
- Create `config/tools/` structure
- Define YAML schema
- Commit: "feat: initial tool factory structure"

### Day 2: Generator Script
- Build `scripts/generate_tools.py`
- Add schema validation
- Commit: "feat: tool factory generator script"

### Day 3: Templates
- Create Jinja2 templates (tool, params, tests)
- Test template rendering
- Commit: "feat: Jinja2 templates for code generation"

### Day 4: First Generated Tool
- Create `echo_tool.yaml`
- Generate code
- Verify tests pass
- Commit: "test: generate and validate echo_tool"

### Day 5: Refinement
- Fix any issues
- Add documentation
- Commit: "docs: tool factory usage guide"

### End of Week: Merge
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/tool-factory-week1
```

## 🚀 Alternative: Start Simple, Evolve Later

If unsure about branching complexity:

**Phase 1:** Work on main with small commits
```bash
# Small, focused commits that keep tests passing
git commit -m "feat: add config/tools directory structure"
git commit -m "feat: add YAML schema definition"
# etc.
```

**Phase 2:** Use branches when experimenting
```bash
# For risky changes, create temporary branch
git checkout -b experiment/new-approach
# Try something
# If it works: merge
# If not: delete branch and go back
```

---

## 🔄 Recovery Strategy

**If branch gets messy:**
```bash
# Save your work
git stash

# Reset to main
git checkout main

# Create fresh branch
git checkout -b feature/tool-factory-week1-v2

# Apply saved work
git stash pop

# Clean start with fresh commits
```

---

## 📊 Commit Message Convention

Use conventional commits for clarity:

```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Bug fix
docs: Documentation changes
test: Add or update tests
refactor: Code refactoring
chore: Maintenance tasks
```

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: create YAML schema for tool definitions"
git commit -m "feat: implement tool factory generator"
git commit -m "test: add tests for generated echo_tool"
git commit -m "docs: add tool factory README"
```

## ❓ Questions to Decide

1. **Feature branch or work on main?**
   - Recommend: Feature branch (`feature/tool-factory-week1`)

2. **How granular should commits be?**
   - Recommend: Commit at logical milestones (end of each task)

3. **When to merge to main?**
   - Recommend: When Week 1 complete and tests passing

4. **Delete old issue docs now or in branch?**
   - Recommend: Now (cleanup main before starting)

---

## 🎬 Next Actions

**Ready to decide:**
1. Do you want feature branch or main?
2. Should we delete resolved issue docs now?
3. Ready to start Week 1 implementation?

---

**Recommendation:** Feature branch strategy, clean up docs now, start Week 1 tool factory.
