## ðŸ”„ Restoring Scripts

If you need to use any of these scripts, simply move them back to the main scripts directory:

```powershell
Move-Item -Path "scripts\archive\script_name.py" -Destination "scripts\script_name.py"
```

Or run them directly from the archive:

```bash
python scripts/archive/script_name.py
```

## ðŸ“‹ Why Archived?

These scripts were moved to the archive to keep the main scripts directory focused on the core workflow for the 6-layer architecture with parameter inheritance:

1. **validate_dto_alignment.py** - Parameter drift detection
2. **generate_tools.py** - Tool generation with inheritance
3. **import_generated_tools.py** - Registry population
4. **show_tools.py** - Verification

The archived scripts remain available for specialized use cases like releases, CI/CD automation, and advanced testing.
