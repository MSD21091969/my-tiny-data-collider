# Branch Development Plan: feature/src-services-integration

**Status:** Milestone 4 Complete (October 11, 2025)

## Overview

The `feature/src-services-integration` branch implements comprehensive DRY/DI (Don't Repeat Yourself / Dependency Injection) refactoring to establish a solid foundation for maintainable, testable service architecture.

## Background

The codebase had hardcoded service instantiation violations throughout, making testing difficult and maintainability poor. Milestone 1 established the core dependency injection framework with ServiceContainer and ServiceManager patterns.

## Key Files

- `src/coreservice/service_container.py`: ServiceContainer and ServiceManager implementation
- `src/casefileservice/service.py`: CasefileService with dependency injection
- `src/tool_sessionservice/service.py`: ToolSessionService with dependency injection
- `src/communicationservice/service.py`: CommunicationService with dependency injection
- `src/coreservice/request_hub.py`: RequestHub refactored to use ServiceManager
- `tests/coreservice/test_request_hub.py`: Updated tests for new architecture

## Milestone Status

### âœ… Milestone 1: Services Architecture Restructure - COMPLETE (Enhanced)

**Completed October 11, 2025:**

- ServiceContainer with lazy instantiation and factory registration
- ServiceManager for high-level service grouping and access

### âœ… Milestone 4: Context-Aware Services - COMPLETE

**Completed October 11, 2025:**
