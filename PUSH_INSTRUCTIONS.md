# Classification Library - Push to Branch

## Quick Verification

```powershell
# 1. Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# 2. Check status
git status

# 3. Review what will be committed
git add classification/
git status
```

## Commit & Push Commands

### Option 1: Using the prepared commit message
```powershell
# Add classification library
git add classification/

# Stage any deletions (model_analysis_tools, moved scripts)
git add -u

# Commit with the prepared message
git commit -F COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt

# Push to your branch
git push origin feature/ETL-RAR-session--datamapping-trans-class-tool-eng-refDI
```

### Option 2: Direct commit
```powershell
# Add and commit in one go
git add classification/
git add -u
git commit -m "feat: establish classification library for tool-method-model engineering

WHAT: Create permanent classification library as foundation for ETL-RAR-session 
data mapping, transformation, and tool engineering

STRUCTURE: classification/ with docs/, tools/, exports/ subdirectories
- 4 foundational documentation files
- 7+ analysis and generation tools (analysis, generators, validators, visualization)
- 80+ model CSV exports with complete field data

CONSOLIDATED FROM:
- docs/archive/* (analytical docs)
- model_analysis_tools/* (core tools)
- scripts/{analysis,generators,validators,visualization}/
- model_exports/ (80 CSV files)

KEY FEATURES:
- Analytical framework for tool/method/model relationships
- Parameter mapping system (bidirectional)
- Orchestration parameter separation
- Meta-tooling for engineering tools
- Pattern recognition and standardization

INTEGRATION: Complements MANAGED_TOOLS, MANAGED_METHODS, ModelRegistry
Supports ETL pipelines, RAR pattern, session-based workflows, DI, tool engineering

REF: classification/README.md"

# Push
git push origin feature/ETL-RAR-session--datamapping-trans-class-tool-eng-refDI
```

## Verification After Push

```powershell
# Verify push succeeded
git log --oneline -1

# Check remote
git ls-remote --heads origin feature/ETL-RAR-session--datamapping-trans-class-tool-eng-refDI

## Branch Context

**Target Branch:** `feature/ETL-RAR-session--datamapping-trans-class-tool-eng-refDI`

**Branch Purpose:** 
- ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipeline development
- RAR (Request-Action-Response) pattern implementation
- Session-based workflow management
- Data mapping and transformation infrastructure
- Classification system for tool engineering
- Reference implementation for dependency injection

**Classification Library Role:**
- Provides foundational classification schemas
- Enables systematic parameter mapping
- Supports ETL data transformations
- Facilitates session-based tool orchestration
- Documents analytical approach to tool engineering

## Post-Push Actions

1. **Verify in GitHub**
   - Check branch exists
   - Review commit message
   - Verify all files uploaded

2. **Update Working Branch** (if needed)
   ```powershell
   # If you want to continue working
   git checkout feature/ETL-RAR-session--datamapping-trans-class-tool-eng-refDI
   git pull origin feature/ETL-RAR-session--datamapping-trans-class-tool-eng-refDI
   ```

3. **Clean Up** (optional)
   ```powershell
   # Remove commit message file
   Remove-Item COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt
   ```

## Notes

- Classification library is now permanent in this branch
- Can be merged to other branches as needed
- All documentation and tools are preserved
- 100% model coverage verified (80 models)
- Ready for Phase 1 implementation
