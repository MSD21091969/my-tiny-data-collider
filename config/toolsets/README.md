# Toolsets Organization

*Last updated: October 7, 2025*

This directory contains organized collections of tool configurations grouped by purpose, implementation patterns, and business logic.

## Structure

## Toolset Categories

### Core Toolsets
**Purpose**: Essential business functionality that implements primary use cases.

**Naming**: `{business_domain}_{operation_type}`
**Examples**:
- `casefile_management` - Casefile CRUD operations
- `user_management` - User account operations
- `document_processing` - Document handling tools

### Helper Toolsets
**Purpose**: Supporting utilities, data transformations, and common operations.

**Naming**: `{functionality}_{scope}`
**Examples**:
- `data_validation` - Input validation helpers
- `format_conversion` - Data format transformers
- `audit_helpers` - Audit trail utilities

### Prototype Toolsets
**Purpose**: Experimental tools for testing new patterns and approaches.

**Naming**: `{experiment_focus}_{variant}`
**Examples**:
- `composite_operations_v1` - Multi-step tool experiments
- `ai_enhanced_tools` - AI-assisted tool patterns
- `performance_optimized` - Performance testing variants

### Workflow Toolsets
**Purpose**: Complex multi-step operations and business processes.

**Naming**: `{business_process}_{automation_level}`
**Examples**:
- `case_investigation_full` - Complete investigation workflow
- `bulk_operations` - Batch processing tools
- `scheduled_tasks` - Time-based automation

## Organization Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each toolset focuses on one clear purpose or business domain.

### 2. Implementation Consistency
Tools within a set follow similar implementation patterns (API calls, data transforms, etc.).

### 3. Business Logic Grouping
Tools are grouped by business rules, permissions, and execution contexts.

### 4. Version Control Ready
Toolsets can be versioned independently for different deployment scenarios.

### 5. Testing Boundaries
Toolsets define natural testing boundaries and performance monitoring scopes.

## Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow
1. **Identify Purpose**: Determine which toolset category fits the new tool
2. **Create Toolset**: Add new subdirectory if needed
3. **Add Tool**: Place YAML configuration in appropriate toolset
4. **Test Integration**: Validate tool works with existing set members
5. **Document Purpose**: Update toolset README with new tool's role

### Maintenance
- **Regular Cleanup**: Remove unused toolsets quarterly
- **Consolidation**: Merge similar toolsets when patterns emerge
- **Documentation**: Keep toolset READMEs current with member tools

### Deployment
- **Selective Deployment**: Deploy toolsets independently based on business needs
- **Version Pinning**: Use toolset versions for stable deployments
- **Gradual Rollout**: Test toolsets in staging before production deployment

## Current Toolsets

### Core / Casefile Management
**Purpose**: Complete casefile lifecycle management
**Tools**: 5 (create, read, update, delete, list)
**Implementation**: API calls to CasefileService
**Business Rules**: Requires authentication, casefile permissions
**Integration**: Internal services with audit logging
