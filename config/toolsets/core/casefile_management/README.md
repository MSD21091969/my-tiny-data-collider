# Casefile Management Toolset

*Last updated: October 7, 2025*

Complete casefile lifecycle management tools implementing CRUD operations with comprehensive business rules and audit trails.

## Overview

This toolset provides the core functionality for managing casefiles throughout their lifecycle. All tools follow consistent patterns for authentication, permissions, and audit logging.

## Tools

### Inheritance-Based Tool Generation

#### Create Casefile (Inherited) (`create_casefile_inherited.yaml`)
- **Purpose**: Initialize new casefiles with metadata using automatic DTO inheritance
- **Approach**: Inherits ALL parameters, business rules, and models from method definition
- **Parameters**: Automatically inherited from `create_casefile` method (title, description, tags, metadata)
- **Business Rules**: Automatically inherited (auth required, casefile:write permission)
- **Integration**: Internal API call to CasefileService.create_casefile
- **Testing**: Embedded YAML test scenarios with happy/unhappy paths

## Key Features

### Automatic Inheritance
- **Zero duplication**: All parameters, rules, and models inherited from method definitions
- **Single source of truth**: Method definitions drive both implementation and tooling
- **Consistent validation**: Business rules automatically applied
- **Type safety**: Pydantic models inherited and enforced

### Embedded Testing
- **YAML-driven scenarios**: Test cases defined alongside tool configuration
- **Environment fixtures**: Standardized test environments (valid_user_session, read_only_user, etc.)
- **Happy/unhappy paths**: Comprehensive validation coverage
- **CI/CD integration**: Automated testing via `python -m tests.helpers.test_runner`

### Session & Permission Management
All tools require:
- Active user session with proper context
- Appropriate casefile permissions (read/write/delete)
- Audit logging with full traceability
- Session metadata capture

## Implementation Pattern

### Tool Configuration Structure
```yaml
name: create_casefile_inherited
display_name: Create Casefile (Inherited)
description: Create a new casefile using automatic DTO inheritance

# INHERITED: All parameters from method definition
# INHERITED: All business rules from method definition
# INHERITED: All validation from method definition

test_scenarios:
  happy_paths:
    - name: "basic_create"
      environment: "valid_user_session"
      input:
        title: "Test Casefile"
      expected:
        status: "COMPLETED"
        has_casefile_id: true
  unhappy_paths:
    - name: "missing_title"
      environment: "valid_user_session"
      input: {}
      expected:
        status: "FAILED"
        error_type: "ValidationError"
```

### Generated Tool Structure
```python
# Automatically generated from YAML + method inheritance
class CreateCasefileInheritedTool:
    def __init__(self):
        # Inherited parameters automatically populated
        self.parameters = inherited_from_method_definition

    async def execute(self, context, **kwargs):
        # Inherited business rules automatically enforced
        # Inherited validation automatically applied
        # Service call with proper context
        return await CasefileService.create_casefile(request)
```

## Testing Strategy

### YAML-Driven Test Scenarios
- **Embedded configuration**: Tests defined in tool YAML
- **Environment fixtures**: Consistent test contexts
- **Automated execution**: `python -m tests.helpers.test_runner`
- **Multiple report formats**: HTML, JSON, summary reports

### Test Environment Fixtures
- `valid_user_session`: Full permissions, active session
- `read_only_user`: Read-only access permissions
- `expired_session_user`: Expired authentication
- `invalid_session_user`: Non-existent session
- `admin_user`: Administrator privileges
- `unauthenticated_user`: No authentication

### Coverage Areas
- Parameter validation (inherited rules)
- Permission checking (business rules)
- Error condition handling
- Response format verification
- Session management
- Audit trail validation

## Migration from Manual Tools

### Previous Approach (Removed)
- Manual YAML configuration for each tool
- Duplicated parameter definitions
- Separate business rule specification
- Manual test file maintenance
- Multiple validation layers

### Current Approach (Inherited)
- Single method definition drives everything
- Automatic tool generation from YAML templates
- Inherited validation and business rules
- Embedded test scenarios
- Unified test execution

## Business Rules (Inherited)

### Session Requirements
- Active user sessions required
- Session context for audit trails
- Session metadata in operations

### Permission Model
- `casefile:read` - View casefile information
- `casefile:write` - Modify casefile data
- `casefile:delete` - Remove casefiles
- Automatic permission checking

### Audit Trail
- All operations logged with user context
- Session information captured
- Operation timestamps recorded
- Error conditions documented

## Performance Characteristics

### Execution Performance
- Fast internal operations (< 200ms typical)
- Minimal external dependencies
- Efficient database queries
- Cached permission checks

### Testing Performance
- Parallel scenario execution
- Fast environment setup/teardown
- Comprehensive coverage without redundancy
- CI/CD optimized execution

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Additions
- Additional inherited tools for full CRUD operations
- Bulk operations support
- Advanced filtering and search
- Casefile templates and workflows
- External system integrations

### Toolset Expansions
- Collaboration features
- Advanced permission models
- Automated lifecycle management
- Analytics and reporting
