# Workflows Toolset

*Last updated: October 7, 2025*

This toolset contains complex multi-step operations that orchestrate multiple tools to accomplish business processes. Workflows represent end-to-end business capabilities.

## Purpose

Workflow tools provide:
- Multi-step business processes
- Tool orchestration and sequencing
- Complex decision logic
- Error handling and compensation
- Business transaction management

## Organization

Workflows are organized by business domain:
- `case_management/` - Complete case lifecycle workflows
- `communication/` - Multi-channel communication flows
- `audit/` - Comprehensive audit and compliance processes
- `integration/` - Cross-system integration workflows

## Usage

Workflow tools should:
- Handle complex business logic
- Provide clear status tracking
- Include compensation actions for failures
- Support resumable operations
- Document business rules and SLAs

## Design Principles

- **Atomicity**: Each step should be independently recoverable
- **Consistency**: Maintain data integrity across steps
- **Isolation**: Steps should not interfere with each other
- **Durability**: Completed steps should persist state

## Error Handling

Workflows must include:
- Step-level error boundaries
- Compensation actions for rollback
- Status tracking and monitoring
- Alert mechanisms for failures
- Recovery procedures

## Examples

- Case creation and assignment workflow
- Multi-step approval processes
- Data migration workflows
- Batch processing operations
- Integration synchronization flows
