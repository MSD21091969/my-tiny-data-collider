# Feature Branch Sync Instructions

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**After:** CI/CD Enhancement Push to `develop`

---

## 🎯 Why Sync Feature Branches?

The `develop` branch now has **6 new workflows** and **enhanced CI/CD automation** that will benefit all feature branches. Each feature branch should merge these updates to:

✅ Get YAML linting validation  
✅ Benefit from enhanced PR comments  
✅ Be tested by parallel branch monitor  
✅ Auto-generate documentation  
✅ Use reusable setup workflow  

---

## 📋 Branches That Need Syncing

All **6 active Week 2 feature branches:**

1. `feature/integration-test-templates`
2. `feature/api-test-templates`
3. `feature/google-workspace-gmail`
4. `feature/google-workspace-drive`
5. `feature/google-workspace-sheets`
6. `feature/tool-composition`

**Note:** `feature/tool-factory-week1` is the base and doesn't need syncing.

## 🚀 How to Sync (For Each Developer)

### **Option A: Merge develop into your feature branch** (Recommended)

```powershell
# 1. Checkout your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-branch-name

# 2. Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# 3. Merge develop into your branch
git merge origin/develop

# 4. Resolve any conflicts (unlikely)
# If conflicts, edit files, then:
# git add .
# git commit

# 5. Push updated branch
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
```

### **Option B: Rebase on develop** (Cleaner history)

```powershell
# 1. Checkout your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-branch-name

# 2. Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# 3. Rebase on develop
git rebase origin/develop

# 4. Resolve any conflicts (if any)
# git add <resolved-files>
# git rebase --continue

# 5. Force push (rebase changes history)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-branch-name
```

## 🎓 Which Option Should You Choose?

### **Choose Merge (Option A) if:**
- ✅ You're working with others on the same branch
- ✅ You want to preserve exact commit history
- ✅ You're not comfortable with rebase
- ✅ **Recommended for most developers**

### **Choose Rebase (Option B) if:**
- ✅ You're the only one on your branch
- ✅ You want a cleaner, linear history
- ✅ You're comfortable with git rebase
- ✅ Your branch has few commits

---

## ⚠️ Expected Conflicts (Unlikely)

Since these are **new files**, conflicts are unlikely. However, if you added:

- Custom workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- Custom YAML linting rules
- Custom documentation generation scripts

You may need to merge manually.

## ✅ What You'll Get After Syncing

### **New Files in Your Branch:**

```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   ├── ci.yml (enhanced)
│   ├── tool-generation.yml (enhanced)
│   ├── auto-docs.yml (new)
│   ├── parallel-branch-tests.yml (new)
│   ├── reusable-setup.yml (new)
│   └── feature-branch-monitor.yml (existing, may need merge)
├── CICD_SETUP_COMPLETE.md (new)
└── ENHANCED_CICD_SUMMARY.md (new)

.yamllint (new)

├── GITHUB_ACTIONS_GUIDE.md (new)
└── WORKFLOW_BEST_PRACTICES.md (new)

scripts/
└── generate_tool_docs.py (new)
```

## 🧪 Verify After Syncing

```powershell
# 1. Check no conflicts remain
git status

# 2. Run tests to ensure nothing broken
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# 3. Verify workflows exist
ls .github/workflows/

# Should see:
# - ci.yml
# - tool-generation.yml
# - feature-branch-monitor.yml
# - auto-docs.yml
# - parallel-branch-tests.yml
# - reusable-setup.yml

# 4. Push and verify GitHub Actions run
git push origin feature/your-branch-name
# Then check: https://github.com/MSD21091969/my-tiny-data-collider/actions
```

3. ✅ Documentation will auto-generate
4. ✅ YAML changes will be validated

**Check parallel test results:**
- Wait for next scheduled run (every 6 hours)
- OR trigger manually: `gh workflow run parallel-branch-tests.yml`
