## 🚀 Start Development

### Quick Start Commands
```powershell
# Pick a feature (example: Integration Test Templates)
git checkout feature/integration-test-templates

# Verify you're on the right branch
git status

# Start coding!
# See issue #10 for full task list
```

### Development Flow
1. **Pick an issue** from #10-#15
2. **Checkout feature branch** (git checkout feature/...)
3. **Code your changes**
4. **Run tests locally** (pytest tests/ -v)
5. **Commit and push** (triggers CI/CD automatically)
6. **Create PR to develop** when ready
7. **CI/CD validates** everything automatically

   - Branch: `feature/integration-test-templates`
   - Creates service-layer test generation
   - Validates policy enforcement
   
2. **Issue #11: API Test Templates** (3-4 days)
   - Branch: `feature/api-test-templates`
   - Creates HTTP-layer test generation
   - Validates end-to-end flows

### Phase 2: Google Workspace Tools (Week 2.2)
**Priority:** High - Can work in parallel

3. **Issue #12: Gmail Toolset** (5-6 days)
   - Branch: `feature/google-workspace-gmail`
   - 4 tools: list, send, search, get messages
   
4. **Issue #13: Drive Toolset** (5-6 days)
   - Branch: `feature/google-workspace-drive`
   - 5 tools: list, upload, download, folder, share
   
5. **Issue #14: Sheets Toolset** (4-5 days)
   - Branch: `feature/google-workspace-sheets`
   - 4 tools: batch_get, batch_update, append, create

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 2.3)
**Priority:** Medium - Depends on Phase 1 & 2

6. **Issue #15: Tool Composition Engine** (5-7 days)
   - Branch: `feature/tool-composition`
   - Enables tool chaining and workflows
   - Most complex feature
