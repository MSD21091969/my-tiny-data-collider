# Solid Setup Status & Next Steps

## Current Status (Oct 1, 2025)

### ✅ Completed
1. **Forked solid-data-wallet** - React Native mobile wallet for Solid pods
   - Repo: `MSD21091969/solid-data-wallet`
   - Location: `C:\Users\HP\Documents\solid-data-wallet`
   - Originally designed for Inrupt's hosted service (not accessible)

2. **Installed Community Solid Server**
   - Global npm package: `@solid/community-server`
   - Version: Latest
   
3. **Committed & Pushed Collider**
   - Repo: `MSD21091969/my-tiny-data-collider`
   - Architecture: Refactored with Firestore subcollections
   - Documentation: Complete manifesto + integration plans

### ⏳ In Progress
- Getting Community Solid Server to run stably on Windows
  - Issue: Server initializes but exits after loading configs
  - Tried: Multiple config approaches, all hit same issue

### 📋 Blockers
1. **Inrupt hosted service** - Not accessible for free accounts
2. **Community Solid Server on Windows** - Unstable/crashes after init

## 🎯 Recommended Path Forward

### Option 1: Linux/WSL for Solid Server (Recommended)
Community Solid Server runs much better on Linux. Two sub-options:

**A) Use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**
```bash
# In PowerShell (Admin)
wsl --install

# Then in WSL Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
npm install -g @solid/community-server
community-solid-server -p 3000
```

**B) Use Docker**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  solid-server:
    image: solidproject/community-server:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./solid-data:/data
```

### Option 2: Focus on Collider First, Solid Later
Since your Python collider works beautifully with Firestore:

1. **Build more tools** for your collider
2. **Curate your corpuses** (legal, financial, technical)
3. **Create domain-specific RAG** implementations
4. **Get value from collider** without Solid dependency

Then add Solid integration once:
- You have WSL2/Docker setup
- OR Community Solid Server Windows issues are resolved
- OR Alternative Solid server emerges

### Option 3: Alternative Solid Servers
Other Solid server implementations to try:

- **Node Solid Server** (older, more stable?)
  ```bash
  npm install -g solid-server
  solid start
  ```

- **Inrupt Pod Spaces** (if enterprise access available)

- **Self-hosted Nextcloud** + Solid plugin (if exists)

## 🔥 What's Working NOW

Your **Tiny Data Collider** is production-ready WITHOUT Solid:

```
✅ Rich session/context management
✅ Firestore persistence with subcollections
✅ Tool execution with full audit trails
✅ Event tracking (tool_request_received → execution → completed → response_sent)
✅ Casefile → Session → Request → Event hierarchy
✅ MDSContext for rich state management
✅ PydanticAI integration
✅ FastAPI server with Swagger UI
✅ Complete documentation & manifesto
```

**You can build value RIGHT NOW** without waiting for Solid!

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### Path A: Try WSL2 for Solid (30 min)
1. Install WSL2
2. Install Node/npm in WSL
3. Run Community Solid Server in WSL
4. Test from Windows browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### Path B: Build More Collider Tools (More Value)
1. Create `corpus_manager` service
2. Build `legal_analysis_tool` (using your domain knowledge)
3. Implement RAG with vector search
4. Add `financial_analysis_tool`
5. Create knowledge graph builder

**Which path sounds better?**

## 📝 Notes

- Solid integration is **nice-to-have**, not **must-have**
- Your collider's value is in:
  - YOUR curated data
  - YOUR domain tools
  - YOUR intelligence layer
- Solid adds **interoperability** but isn't the core value prop
- Focus on building tools that solve YOUR problems first

---

## 🎯 Decision Point

**Choose:**
1. Try WSL2 for Solid server (30 min investment)
2. Build more collider functionality (immediate value)
3. Hybrid: Build collider tools, revisit Solid later

**What feels right?** 🤔
